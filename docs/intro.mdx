Releasaurus is nothing fancy.
It's simply a static site generator (Docusaurus) alongside some scripts that leverage Github Actions.

With Releasaurus, it is very easy to build an automated workflow for generating and hosting release notes from a centralised place.
You can even have Releasaurus manage release notes from multiple projects!

The best part? All this is absolutely **free**!


### Just Show Me the Money

*Releasaurus is cool and all, but I don't really care about the details and dinosaurs have **literally** been dead for millions of years. Just tell me how I can add another project.*

If you want to be like this - fine. Assuming someone else has already setup Releasaurus, you can jump straight to [this step](Releasaurus/attaching-a-github-repo).

### How Does it Work?

Here is a diagram of a workflow for Releasaurus. It is quite simple. Some details in the diagram are not accurate but it's okay to ignore.
