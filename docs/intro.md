Releasaurus is nothing fancy.
It's simply a static site generator (Docusaurus) alongside some scripts that leverage Github Actions.

With Releasaurus, it is very easy to build an automated workflow for generating and hosting release notes from a centralised place.
You can even have Releasaurus manage release notes from multiple projects!

The best part? All this is absolutely **free**!


### Just Show Me the Money

*Releasaurus is cool and all, but I don't really care about the details and dinosaurs have **literally** been dead for millions of years. Just tell me how I can add another project.*

If you want to be like this - fine.

Assuming someone else has already setup Releasaurus, you can jump straight to [this step](Releasaurus/attach-a-repo).
