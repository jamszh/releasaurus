I'll keep this brief as Releasaurus doesn't really have anything to do with the CHANGELOG generation process.

However, it is absolutely necessary to have some sort of automation if you want Releasaurus to be of any use.

Here are some tools for this:
- [release-please](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/release-please-action) Github action
  - I've only worked with this
- [cookpete/auto-changelog](https://github.com/cookpete/auto-changelog)
